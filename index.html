        <p class="light-text">
          When analyzing pixel art, it is crucial to understand that these
          styles—'Low-Bit,' 'High-Bit,' 'Retro,' and 'Future'—are not mutually
          exclusive categories. Instead, they should be viewed as independent
          dimensions or axes that can be blended in various ratios to create a
          unique, hybrid aesthetic.

            <h3>Low-Bit Pixel Art</h3>
            <p>
              A style that strictly adheres to the technical constraints of
              early hardware (e.g., 8-bit consoles like the NES or handhelds
              like the Game Boy). It is characterized by very low resolutions,
              severely limited color palettes, and simple, "chunky" sprites. The
              focus is on technical authenticity.

            <h3>High-Bit (Hi-Bit) Pixel Art</h3>
            <p>
              A modern evolution of pixel art that uses a pixel-based aesthetic
              but intentionally breaks classic limitations. It features high
              resolutions, vast color palettes, smooth animations, and modern
              post-processing effects such as dynamic lighting, particle
              effects, and reflections.

            <h3>Retro Pixel Art</h3>
            <p>
              A broad aesthetic category that aims to evoke the nostalgic look
              and feel of games from the 8-bit and 16-bit eras (1980s-1990s).
              The focus is less on strict technical limitations and more on
              capturing the thematic essence, color choices, and character
              design conventions of that time.

            <h3>Future Pixel Art</h3>
            <p>
              A thematic style defined by its subject matter rather than its
              technical execution. It uses pixel art to depict sci-fi,
              cyberpunk, or futuristic concepts, often characterized by neon-lit
              cityscapes, advanced technology, robotic designs, and a dystopian
              (or utopian) atmosphere.

            "...even with pixels, in those very small drawings, you can bring
            out a lot of emotions with small details like a character bowing or
            raising his hand, those kinds of things and that's how we created
            that dramatic tone."
